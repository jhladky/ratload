Version 1 03/02/15
   * Initial project release.

Version 2 03/04/15
   * Switched to using a new UART.

   * Renamed "serial_test" directory to "testing".
   * Added reference bit file to "testing" directory.
   * Clarified and improved some of the installation instructions, and added instructions about using the reference bit file to the troubleshooting section. Added a section about interrupts.

Version 3 03/05/15
   * Fixed a bug in the ratload program where serial device names would be concatenated together.
   * Added an instruction in Section 3 telling users to remove any previous prog roms, and fixed typos in Secs 2.1 and 2.2.
   * Renamed "Contact" section to "Project Information". Added credit for UART module.
